### Author: Eli Ewa

## **Notes

Please be aware that although I have technically 4 pages on this site, only the home page and "movies" are functional as per the assignment requirements. Later on I will fill the other pages with content from a public API.

## Components

- TheNav.vue -> Global nav component
